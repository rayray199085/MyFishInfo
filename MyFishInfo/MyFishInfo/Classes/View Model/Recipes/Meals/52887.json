Add the spices, season with salt, then continue to fry until the mix start to go brown and fragrant; about 3 mins.\r\nAdd the rice and stir in well. Add 600ml water, stir, then bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer, then cover for 10 mins. Take off the heat and leave to stand, covered, for 10-15 mins more. The rice will be perfectly cooked if you do not lift the lid before the end of the cooking.\r\nMeanwhile, put the haddock and bay leaves in a frying pan, cover with the milk, then poach for 10 mins until the flesh flakes. Remove from the milk, peel away the skin, then flake the flesh into thumbsize pieces. Place the eggs in a pan, cover with water, bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Leave for 4\u00bd-5 mins, plunge into cold water, then peel and cut the eggs into quarters. Gently mix the fish, eggs, parsley, coriander and rice together in the pan. Serve hot, sprinkled with a few extra herbs.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/utxqpt1511639216.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_Pw1I1-SItE","strIngredient1":"Smoked Haddock","strIngredient2":"Bay Leaves","strIngredient3":"Milk","strIngredient4":"Eggs","strIngredient5":"Parsley","strIngredient6":"Coriander","strIngredient7":"Vegetable Oil","strIngredient8":"Onion","strIngredient9":"Coriander","strIngredient10":"Curry Powder","strIngredient11":"Rice","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"300g","strMeasure2":"2","strMeasure3":"300ml ","strMeasure4":"4","strMeasure5":"Handful","strMeasure6":"Handful","strMeasure7":"2 tbs","strMeasure8":"1 chopped","strMeasure9":"1 tsp ","strMeasure10":"2 tsp","strMeasure11":"300g","strMeasure12":"","strMeasure13":"","strMeasure14":"","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https:\/\/www.bbcgoodfood.com\/recipes\/10421\/kedgeree","dateModified":null}]}
